Writing Your First Application - 编写你的第一个应用
==============================

.. note:: If you're not yet familiar with the fundamental architecture of a
          Fabric network, you may want to visit the :doc:`key_concepts` section
          prior to continuing.

          It is also worth noting that this tutorial serves as an introduction
          to Fabric applications and uses simple smart contracts and
          applications. For a more in-depth look at Fabric applications and
          smart contracts, check out our

          本教程的价值仅限于介绍 Fabric 应用和使用简单的智能合约和应用。更深入的了解 Fabric 应用和智能合约请查看 :doc:`developapps/developing_applications` 或 :doc:`tutorial/commercial_paper` 部分

In this tutorial we'll be looking at a handful of sample programs to see how
Fabric apps work. These applications and the smart contracts they use are
collectively known as ``FabCar``. They provide a great starting point to
understand a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. You'll learn how to write an
application and smart contract to query and update a ledger, and how to use a
Certificate Authority to generate the X.509 certificates used by applications
which interact with a permissioned blockchain.

it enables an application to use identities, wallets, and gateways to connect to
channels, submit transactions, and wait for notifications. This tutorial also
uses the ``fabric-ca-client`` class to enroll users with their respective
certificate authorities, generating a valid identity which is then used by
``fabric-network`` class methods.

Enrolling the admin user
------------------------

.. note:: The following two sections involve communication with the Certificate
          Authority. You may find it useful to stream the CA logs when running
          the upcoming programs by opening a new terminal shell and running
          ``docker logs -f ca.example.com``.

When we created the network, an admin user --- literally called ``admin`` ---
was created as the **registrar** for the certificate authority (CA). Our first
step is to generate the private key, public key, and X.509 certificate for
``admin`` using the ``enroll.js`` program. This process uses a **Certificate
Signing Request** (CSR) --- the private and public key are first generated
locally and the public key is then sent to the CA which returns an encoded
certificate for use by the application. These three credentials are then stored
in the wallet, allowing us to act as an administrator for the CA.

We will subsequently register and enroll a new application user which will be
used by our application to interact with the blockchain.

Let's enroll user ``admin``:

.. code:: bash

  node enrollAdmin.js

This command has stored the CA administrator's credentials in the ``wallet``
directory.

Register and enroll ``user1``
-----------------------------

Now that we have the administrator's credentials in a wallet, we can enroll a
new user --- ``user1`` --- which will be used to query and update the ledger:

.. code:: bash

  node registerUser.js

Similar to the admin enrollment, this program uses a CSR to enroll ``user1`` and
store its credentials alongside those of ``admin`` in the wallet. We now have
identities for two separate users --- ``admin`` and ``user1`` --- and these are
used by our application.

Time to interact with the ledger...

Querying the ledger
-------------------

Each peer in a blockchain network hosts a copy of the ledger, and an application
program can query the ledger by invoking a smart contract which queries the most
recent value of the ledger and returns it to the application.

Here is a simplified representation of how a query works:

.. image:: tutorial/write_first_app.diagram.1.png

Applications read data from the `ledger <./ledger/ledger.html>`_ using a query.
The most common queries involve the current values of data in the ledger -- its
`world state <./ledger/ledger.html#world-state>`_. The world state is
represented as a set of key-value pairs, and applications can query data for a
single key or multiple keys. Moreover, the ledger world state can be configured
to use a database like CouchDB which supports complex queries when key-values
are modeled as JSON data. This can be very helpful when looking for all assets
that match certain keywords with particular values; all cars with a particular
owner, for example.

First, let's run our ``query.js`` program to return a listing of all the cars on
the ledger. This program uses our second identity -- ``user1`` -- to access the
ledger:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

The output should look like this:

.. code:: json

  Wallet path: ...fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet
  Transaction has been evaluated, result is:
  [{"Key":"CAR0", "Record":{"colour":"blue","make":"Toyota","model":"Prius","owner":"Tomoko"}},
  {"Key":"CAR1", "Record":{"colour":"red","make":"Ford","model":"Mustang","owner":"Brad"}},
  {"Key":"CAR2", "Record":{"colour":"green","make":"Hyundai","model":"Tucson","owner":"Jin Soo"}},
  {"Key":"CAR3", "Record":{"colour":"yellow","make":"Volkswagen","model":"Passat","owner":"Max"}},
  {"Key":"CAR4", "Record":{"colour":"black","make":"Tesla","model":"S","owner":"Adriana"}},
  {"Key":"CAR5", "Record":{"colour":"purple","make":"Peugeot","model":"205","owner":"Michel"}},
  {"Key":"CAR6", "Record":{"colour":"white","make":"Chery","model":"S22L","owner":"Aarav"}},
  {"Key":"CAR7", "Record":{"colour":"violet","make":"Fiat","model":"Punto","owner":"Pari"}},
  {"Key":"CAR8", "Record":{"colour":"indigo","make":"Tata","model":"Nano","owner":"Valeria"}},
  {"Key":"CAR9", "Record":{"colour":"brown","make":"Holden","model":"Barina","owner":"Shotaro"}}]

Let's take a closer look at this program. Use an editor (e.g. atom or visual
studio) and open ``query.js``.

The application starts by bringing in scope two key classes from the
``fabric-network`` module; ``FileSystemWallet`` and ``Gateway``. These classes
will be used to locate the ``user1`` identity in the wallet, and use it to
connect to the network:

.. code:: bash

  const { FileSystemWallet, Gateway } = require('fabric-network');

The application connects to the network using a gateway:

.. code:: bash

  const gateway = new Gateway();
  await gateway.connect(ccp, { wallet, identity: 'user1' });

This code creates a new gateway and then uses it to connect the application to
the network. ``ccp`` describes the network that the gateway will access with the
identity ``user1`` from ``wallet``. See how the ``ccp`` has been loaded from
``../../basic-network/connection.json`` and parsed as a JSON file:

.. code:: bash

  const ccpPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', 'basic-network', 'connection.json');
  const ccpJSON = fs.readFileSync(ccpPath, 'utf8');
  const ccp = JSON.parse(ccpJSON);

If you'd like to understand more about the structure of a connection profile,
and how it defines the network, check out
`the connection profile topic <./developapps/connectionprofile.html>`_. 

A network can be divided into multiple channels, and the next important line of
code connects the application to a particular channel within the network,
``mychannel``:

.. code:: bash
  const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');

  const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');

Within this channel, we can access the smart contract ``fabcar`` to interact
with the ledger:

.. code:: bash

  const contract = network.getContract('fabcar');

Within ``fabcar`` there are many different **transactions**, and our application
initially uses the ``queryAllCars`` transaction to access the ledger world state
data:

.. code:: bash

  const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('queryAllCars');

The ``evaluateTransaction`` method represents one of the simplest interaction
with a smart contract in blockchain network. It simply picks a peer defined in
the connection profile and sends the request to it, where it is evaluated. The
smart contract queries all the cars on the peer's copy of the ledger and returns
the result to the application. This interaction does not result in an update the
ledger.

The FabCar smart contract
-------------------------

Let's take a look at the transactions within the ``FabCar`` smart contract.
Navigate to the ``chaincode/fabcar/javascript/lib`` subdirectory at the root of
``fabric-samples`` and open ``fabcar.js`` in your editor.

See how our smart contract is defined using the ``Contract`` class:

.. code:: bash

  class FabCar extends Contract {...

Within this class structure, you'll see that we have the following
transactions defined: ``initLedger``, ``queryCar``, ``queryAllCars``,
``createCar``, and ``changeCarOwner``. For example:


.. code:: bash

  async queryCar(ctx, carNumber) {...}
  async queryAllCars(ctx) {...}

Let's take a closer look at the ``queryAllCars`` transaction to see how it
interacts with the ledger.

.. code:: bash

  async queryAllCars(ctx) {

    const startKey = 'CAR0';
    const endKey = 'CAR999';

    const iterator = await ctx.stub.getStateByRange(startKey, endKey);


This code defines the range of cars that ``queryAllCars`` will retrieve from the
ledger. Every car between ``CAR0`` and ``CAR999`` -- 1,000 cars in all, assuming
every key has been tagged properly -- will be returned by the query. The
remainder of the code iterates through the query results and packages them into
JSON for the application.

Below is a representation of how an application would call different
transactions in a smart contract. Each transaction uses a broad set of APIs such
as ``getStateByRange`` to interact with the ledger. You can read more about
these APIs in `detail
<https://fabric-shim.github.io/master/index.html?redirect=true>`_.

.. image:: images/RunningtheSample.png

We can see our ``queryAllCars`` transaction, and another called ``createCar``.
We will use this later in the tutorial to update the ledger, and add a new block
to the blockchain.

But first, go back to the ``query`` program and change the
``evaluateTransaction`` request to query ``CAR4``. The ``query`` program should
now look like this:

.. code:: bash

  const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('queryCar', 'CAR4');

Save the program and navigate back to your ``fabcar/javascript`` directory.
Now run the ``query`` program again:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

You should see the following:

.. code:: json

  Wallet path: ...fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet
  Transaction has been evaluated, result is:
  {"colour":"black","make":"Tesla","model":"S","owner":"Adriana"}

If you go back and look at the result from when the transaction was
``queryAllCars``, you can see that ``CAR4`` was Adriana’s black Tesla model S,
which is the result that was returned here.

We can use the ``queryCar`` transaction to query against any car, using its
key (e.g. ``CAR0``) and get whatever make, model, color, and owner correspond to
that car.

Great. At this point you should be comfortable with the basic query transactions
in the smart contract and the handful of parameters in the query program.

Time to update the ledger...

Updating the ledger
-------------------

Now that we’ve done a few ledger queries and added a bit of code, we’re ready to
update the ledger. There are a lot of potential updates we could make, but
let's start by creating a **new** car.

From an application perspective, updating the ledger is simple. An application
submits a transaction to the blockchain network, and when it has been
validated and committed, the application receives a notification that
the transaction has been successful. Under the covers this involves the process
of **consensus** whereby the different components of the blockchain network work
together to ensure that every proposed update to the ledger is valid and
performed in an agreed and consistent order.

.. image:: tutorial/write_first_app.diagram.2.png

Above, you can see the major components that make this process work. As well as
the multiple peers which each host a copy of the ledger, and optionally a copy
of the smart contract, the network also contains an ordering service. The
ordering service coordinates transactions for a network; it creates blocks
containing transactions in a well-defined sequence originating from all the
different applications connected to the network.

Our first update to the ledger will create a new car. We have a separate program
called ``invoke.js`` that we will use to make updates to the ledger. Just as with
queries, use an editor to open the program and navigate to the code block where
we construct our transaction and submit it to the network:

.. code:: bash

  await contract.submitTransaction('createCar', 'CAR12', 'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom');

See how the applications calls the smart contract transaction ``createCar`` to
create a black Honda Accord with an owner named Tom. We use ``CAR12`` as the
identifying key here, just to show that we don't need to use sequential keys.

Save it and run the program:

.. code:: bash

  node invoke.js

If the invoke is successful, you will see output like this:

.. code:: bash

  Wallet path: ...fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet
  2018-12-11T14:11:40.935Z - info: [TransactionEventHandler]: _strategySuccess: strategy success for transaction "9076cd4279a71ecf99665aed0ed3590a25bba040fa6b4dd6d010f42bb26ff5d1"
  Transaction has been submitted

Notice how the ``invoke`` application interacted with the blockchain network
using the ``submitTransaction`` API, rather than ``evaluateTransaction``.

.. code:: bash

  await contract.submitTransaction('createCar', 'CAR12', 'Honda', 'Accord', 'Black', 'Tom');

``submitTransaction`` is much more sophisticated than ``evaluateTransaction``.
Rather than interacting with a single peer, the SDK will send the
``submitTransaction`` proposal to every required organization's peer in the
blockchain network. Each of these peers will execute the requested smart
contract using this proposal, to generate a transaction response which it signs
and returns to the SDK. The SDK collects all the signed transaction responses
into a single transaction, which it then sends to the orderer. The orderer
collects and sequences transactions from every application into a block of
transactions. It then distributes these blocks to every peer in the network,
where every transaction is validated and committed. Finally, the SDK is
notified, allowing it to return control to the application.

``submitTransaction`` does all this for the application! The process by which
the application, smart contract, peers and ordering service work together to
keep the ledger consistent across the network is called consensus, and it is
explained in detail in this `section <./peers/peers.html>`_.

To see that this transaction has been written to the ledger, go back to
``query.js`` and change the argument from ``CAR4`` to ``CAR12``.

In other words, change this:

.. code:: bash

  const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('queryCar', 'CAR4');

To this:

.. code:: bash

  const result = await contract.evaluateTransaction('queryCar', 'CAR12');

Save once again, then query:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

Which should return this:

.. code:: bash

  Wallet path: ...fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet
  Transaction has been evaluated, result is:
  {"colour":"Black","make":"Honda","model":"Accord","owner":"Tom"}

Congratulations. You’ve created a car and verified that its recorded on the
ledger!

So now that we’ve done that, let’s say that Tom is feeling generous and he
wants to give his Honda Accord to someone named Dave.

To do this, go back to ``invoke.js`` and change the smart contract transaction
from ``createCar`` to ``changeCarOwner`` with a corresponding change in input
arguments:

.. code:: bash

  await contract.submitTransaction('changeCarOwner', 'CAR12', 'Dave');

The first argument --- ``CAR12`` --- identifies the car that will be changing
owners. The second argument --- ``Dave`` --- defines the new owner of the car.

Save and execute the program again:

.. code:: bash

  node invoke.js

Now let’s query the ledger again and ensure that Dave is now associated with the
``CAR12`` key:

.. code:: bash

  node query.js

It should return this result:

.. code:: bash

   Wallet path: ...fabric-samples/fabcar/javascript/wallet
   Transaction has been evaluated, result is:
   {"colour":"Black","make":"Honda","model":"Accord","owner":"Dave"}

The ownership of ``CAR12`` has been changed from Tom to Dave.

.. note:: In a real world application the smart contract would likely have some
          access control logic. For example, only certain authorized users may
          create new cars, and only the car owner may transfer the car to
          somebody else.

Summary
-------

Now that we’ve done a few queries and a few updates, you should have a pretty
good sense of how applications interact with a blockchain network using a smart
contract to query or update the ledger. You’ve seen the basics of the roles
smart contracts, APIs, and the SDK play in queries and updates and you should
have a feel for how different kinds of applications could be used to perform
other business tasks and operations.

As we said in the introduction, we have a whole section on
:doc:`developapps/developing_applications` that includes in-depth information on
smart contracts, process and data design, a tutorial using a more in-depth
Commercial Paper `tutorial <./tutorial/commercial_paper.html>`_ and a large
amount of other material relating to the development of applications.
