# Lab Name
Fabric Docs CN

# Short Description
A project to translate the Fabric documentation to Chinese

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to translate the Fabric documentation to Chinese. We will use this repository to sync with the latest English version. The proposal for doing this is to compare the changes of latest English doc and the current doc we are working on. And update the source file in a new release base branch. Issues are used to track what to update in the changed docs. Translator can merge/reuse the existing translation to the changed docs and focus on the changed part.
 
The original online documentation is http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/
